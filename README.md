# Networking for developers: our talk at Devoxx2024


I just got back from [Devoxx](https://www.devoxx.fr/about-us/), a tech event for developers held every year in different locations around the world, including Paris. And it was awesome! There were keynote speakers, workshops and discussions led by experts in the tech industry. Of course, there were also the usual booths and exhibitors, and Microsoft along with GitHub were running one of them.

I'm a network engineer, so you might be wondering why I was at a developer event. To be honest, I was wondering the same thing when my colleague [David](https://github.com/davidsntg) suggested we submit a Call For Paper for Devoxx. We thought our talk on networking for developers might be a long shot, but it got selected! Probably because of the Back to the Future reference in the title (The closely it could translate to is "Ping is working, the network is fine Marty!")

As a speaker, I had access to the event for all three days, so I decided to join the Microsoft booth crew and got to chat with visitors, for example to tell them the stories behind Microsoft Developer's raccoon mascot or GitHub's famous Octocat :smiley:. It was also super cool to meet with some of my own customers, learn about new technologies and trends, network with my GitHub colleagues and other techies, and get inspired by their own projects. Oh, and collect stickers. Lots of stickers.

But let's talk about the talk. It was my first time speaking at a public event and I was scared out of my mind. There were about 4000 visitors a day, our conference room could fit 300 people and it was full. A perfect opportunity to practice! After feedback from colleagues during dry-run sessions and many rounds of rehearsal, I think I finally felt ready.

And you know what? I loved being a speaker! I was definitely not the smoothest out there, but I didn't freeze up or shake with a trembling voice either, so I am still calling it a win. A big thank you to David for the public speaking coaching and to all our colleagues who helped us prepare. Can't wait for the next one!
